# Project TODO

- [x] Ship hero CTA experiment instrumentation, beacon fallback, and sitemap endpoint.
- [x] Add WebP conversion tooling, CI workflow, and quick visual wins (CTA styling, sale ribbon, hero preload).
- [x] Build the visual demo route / UI showcase (Option C) to present hero variants and design tokens.
- [x] Establish the shared design token system and theming documentation after the visual demo is in place.
- [ ] Document how to use the new hero demo page in `docs/IMAGE_CI.md` or README for future contributors.
- [ ] Follow up on image conversion gaps by re-running targeted WebP jobs for any large uploads still missing optimized formats.
